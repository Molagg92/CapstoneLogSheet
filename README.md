# Capstone Time log 

## `8am - 9am`
woke up late, took time to get started and set up the repo.

## `9am - 10am`
i guess my first move shoud be to draw out the schema or make some kind of plan.

## `10m - 2 pm`
it took forever, but this is more or less what I was thinking interms of the backend logic.
I am going to have to learn more about the DateTime datatype.

## `2pm - 5pm`
did independent research throguh stackoverflow, youtube, and chat GPT on diffrent ways people use DATETIME.
the day sort of got away from me.
